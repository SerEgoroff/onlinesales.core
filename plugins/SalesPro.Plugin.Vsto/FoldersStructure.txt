This file describes the folders structure of VSTO data on the local file system.
Tegs (words in angle brackets like <ROOT>) mean certain variable values, which are explained below.

<ROOT>  \<SUBFOLDER1>
        \<SUBFILDER2>
        ...
        \<SUBFILDERn>   \Setup.exe
                        \<RESOURCE_NAME>.vsto
                        \Application Files  \<RESOURCE_NAME>_<VERSION_1>
                                            \<RESOURCE_NAME>_<VERSION_2>
                                            ...
                                            \<RESOURCE_NAME>_<VERSION_n>    \<RESOURCE_NAME>.vsto
                                                                            \<FILE_1>
                                                                            \<FILE_2>
                                                                            \...
                                                                            \<FILE_n>

<ROOT>          - the root folder of data, providing with the plugin, in the file system. It is specified in pluginsettings.json via the 'LocalPath' parameter.
                It may start from slash '/' (the path from local root directory), from drive name ('C:', 'X:'...) or from optional dot '.'.
                In the last case the plugin starts looking for data from its assembly folder.
<SUBFOLDER>     - an optional subfolder under the root one. Could be used to separate different languages (EN, RU, etc.) or different variants of resource
                (Comunity, Professional, Ultimate...). This subfolder may be combined (contains of a few folders) or empty.
<RESOURCE_NAME> - the name of downloaded resource.
<VERSION_X>     - version of resource, when dotes '.' is replaced with underscore '_'.
                E.g., if the version is 4.5.0.14999 then this tag contains value '4_5_0_14999'.
<FILE_X>        - some files, of which the resource contains (assemplies, data files, etc.).
